## Gears

### Description
In This assignment, we had to make 4 different sized gears with different amounts of teeth using configurations, global variables, and equations in Solidworks.

### Lessons Learned
This assignment was tough becausae it was my first time using configurations in solidworks. I had trouble because sometime sI would accidentally apply certain features to gears that were not supposed to have them. Once I got pass this though, it wasn't too hard of an assignment.

## Gearbox

### Description
In this assignment, we used the gears that we made in the last assignment to assemble a gearbox that utilized gear mates.

### Lessons Learned
This assignment was the first time that we used gear mates. They were not too hard to figure out, but there were times where I would accidentally put in the wrong number of teeth for one of the gears and the rotation would become out of sync. It was also hard when we had to make the side plate for the gearbox because we were not given really any measurements besides the radius of a couple of circles. We basically had to make the gears mated before we could create the plate pieces. Also, there was trouble when we had to make the knob. it involved a lot of revolved boss bases and cuts which were a bit hard to visualize.

## Motion Study

### Description
In this assigment, we made a bunch of brand new pieces and created an assembly out of them. We then had to create a motion study inside the assembly to show how the shelf piece would behave when pushed up or let down by a servo arm.

### Lessons Learned
The assembly part of this assignment was pretty easy because we had done many things like that before. The hard part was properly using the motion study tool, which we were using for the first time. For me, I had issues with the servo arm moving in the wrong direction when the play button was hit. Changing the switch direction button didn't do anything, but we found out that it wasn't updating because I wasn't changing it inside the animation time of 3 seconds, I was changing it around 5 seconds after when everything was already done running.

## Stress Analysis

### Description
In this assignment, we made a new part and then ran a stress analysis to see how it behaved when put under pressure from one of it's sides.

### Lessons Learned
In this assignment we learned how to use the stress analysis tool. This is helpful because it shows you how the part that you made will hold up against high pressures, and it also shows what areas of the part are the weakest. I had issues with how strong my part was. The part I had was almost identical to the one that the person sitting next to me had, yet mine was around half the strength. It was because I had accidentally created 2 forces, both 4000N of force, but I was only supposed to have 1.
